<h1>Get heard</h1>

<p>Today with so many competing artsits it can be hard to get yourself heard. With the right actions and enough effort and persistence you can become famous in no-time as long you've got the talent to back it up.</p>

<h2>Developing a brand</h2>

<h3>Social Media</h3>
<h4>YouTube</h4>
<h4>Soundcloud</h4>
<p>Soundcloud is great for
<h4>Facebook</h4>
<p>Post lots of videos of your songs on Facebook and tell people what you've been up to.</p>
<h3>Venues</h3>
<p>There are many public venues who want musicians. Go to everyone thats appropriate - bars, cafes, weddings, community events - speak to the person organising it and ask if you can play for them next time. If you show up willing to play for cheap or even free and you are really good they will definitely give you a shot. You'll also be publicising yourself to everyone who comes to watch as well.<p>
<h3>Connections</h3>
<p>Talk to everyone about your music and what you want to do, before long you'll meet someone who will help you out and get you going.</p>
